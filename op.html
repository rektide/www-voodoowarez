<p>testing testing. is this mic on?<br>
hello, and welcome to the object platform: birth of the computing ecosystem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>the application is legacy. all software exists in an ecosystem, each piece
a member of a greater computing environment. faced with the deeply
intertwined nature of our systems, the object platform aims to provide a
platform which empowers everyday users to seamlessly shape and craft the
connections, components and relations of their world to their own ends; to
serve as a playground for experimentation and customization of our digital
worlds. we wish to recast the pieces of our digital world to reflect the
loosely coupled nature of an ecosystem;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>technically, the object platform is an experimental runtime environment
for real time and disconnected coordination, providing interaction and
modification of distirubted objects through federated identity spaces.
crafted as a transactional <a href="http://www.luca.demon.co.uk/Ambit/Ambit.html">mobile ambient</a>
systems, the object platform purports to deliver a new level of "application
interoperability". it derives largely from the concept of a federated object
database to provide extensiblity and security across distributed systems. all
of these capbilities are built on a rock-bed of <a href="http://www.sidhe.org/%7Edan/blog/archives/000276.html">dynamic
typing</a> and eager replication transactions. together, voodoo warez
technologies believes this provides a seamless high performance platform for
heterogenous pervasive computing.  <em>the new ecosystem.</em>  err, like we
said, <em>technically</em>....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>the object platform was crafted on the central philosophy of the [<a href="index.html">allegory of the code</a>], the philosophy that an
application is nothing more than a shadow puppet errected to obfuscate and
manipulate how we view the raw primitives which make up our system. under the
name of usability, application builders force monolithic systems upon hapless
users and beg to be loved for having divined their perfect system. the
purpose of the object platform is to rethink user interface by doing away
with the obfuscation of the application; building systems out of of objects
directly and permitting the user to interact with not just the final external
interface but the inner workings of their systems as well. in the object
platform, applications are merely configurations of objects, objects the user
is free to manipulate directly should she choose. witness [<a href="demos.html">demonstrations</a>] for our first primitive use cases.</p>

<h4><strong>[</strong><a href="op.txt">Google Summer of Code Proposal: The New Ecology</a><strong>]</strong></h4>

<p>high level overview and technical description</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In ecology, an ecosystem is a naturally occurring assemblage of organisms
(...) living together with their environment (or biotope), functioning as a
unit of sorts."</p>
<p>"Ecosystem," Wikipedia, July 10, 2005.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Object Platform hopes to provide a suitable technical environment to
allow for the change, interconnection and evolution of presently isolated
software units to form a growing living pervasive software ecosystem. The
Object Platform purports to create a deeply nested transactional virtual
memory system within the existing Common Language Infrastructure runtime (the
virtual machine underneath dotNet) and links this object
memory system to a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and Liberty
Alliance federated identity framework to allow for operation across untrusted
and sometimes-disconnected systems. This serves as groundwork to allow the
Object Platform to provide natural exposure to programs, users, scripts and
daemons to the running application's object model, along with an integrated
dynamic typing system to allow for modification, alteration and
supplementation. These three components, the transactional object layer, the
standards based federated identity system and dynamic typing extension allow
for evolution of a new software ecosystem across formerly isolated disparate
systems and disparate applications. </p>

<h4><strong>[</strong><span class="silvered">Dear Lord, <em><strong>Why</strong>?!</em></span><strong>]</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Case example.  [<a href="spiffynet.html">SpiffyNet</a>] was to be the pinnacle achievement, a
home automation system to link together the dispirate devices of the home and
achieve control.  But control was too amorphous.  As SpiffyNet came online I
realized control could not be centralized.  I bought a fancy USB remote.  When
I was watching a movie, I wanted it to control that.  When I was listening to
music, it should control that.  If it was plugged into my laptop, I wanted it
to still work across the network.  All these activities seemed like they should
be little more than simple scripts.  But I needed an operating environment to script
them in.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus The Object Platform.  Everything would be easily reconfigurable live.  The remote could easily
shift its destination, and it no longer mattered what computer it was physically attached to.</p>

<h4><strong>[</strong><span class="silvered">Current Status</span><strong>]</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Object Platform is in its second major revision, pending release in
early January `06.</p>
<p>It is an open source project. Exact license To Be Determined.</p>
