<h1>SpiffyNet Automation</h1>
<h2>Burn your remote, because its going to be a whole new ball game.</h2>

<p style="font-size: -2">This page is pretty old.  Sorry.  Still mostly factual,
however much of the phase two conceptualization has been
pushed into the <a href="op.html">Object Platform</a>.</p>

<p>SpiffyNet is all about control, specifically giving people back control of
the devices in their home or office. We believe your power over your
household appliaces shouldnt be dictated by how well you can decrypt your
VCR, or the usage of some archaic device interaction scripting interface.
Call us heretics, but we'd like to think anyone should be given any level of
control they're capable of visualizing. You imagine it, the technology makes
it possible.</p>

<p>So whats in order to manifest this hokie idea? It's a two part process
really. First, we have to <a href="phase.one.html">take control</a> of our
electronic world, or whatever corners of it we subject to our technological
tinkering. Then we have to figure out in turn how to give that control back
over the users, the people of this world: we must <a href="phase.two.html">reconcieve interface</a>.</p>

<p>The first parts pretty straight forward. We need to take control. Get the
devices to a level where the keyboard cowboy code jockeys of the world can
make the devices dance like they want. This part, while in no means trivial,
is reducable to simple practice. The trick isnt even doing it, that part isnt
even so hard, its doing it <i>right. </i>For this to be any more than a
glimmering of a good idea, it needs to be extensible enough.</p>

<p>After we've taken control, its time to start bringing that control down in
step to simpler levels. To do this, there needs to be some sort of
fundamental revolution to the button pushing mentality. Because, frankly,
whatever the cause, people have buttonphobia. Light switches cause unease,
video game controllers confusion, keyboards can break sweats, and sound
boards cause general queasiness. The amount of control we're talking about
giving people could give a healthy man a heart attack from thirty paces,
assuming he understood what he was looking at. If all these options are ever
going to become anything resembling control, we need a new way for people to
talk to their devices. This is part two, the innovation of bridging the
technological grand canyon between the tech heads and the common man.</p>

<p>For those seeking some serious linkage, might I suggest the <a href="http://www.homeautomationindex.com/">Home Automation Index</a>, a great
site for generation one home automation systems. <a href="http://www.epanorama.net/">ePanorama</a> (an <i>excellent </i>hardware
hacker website) also has sections on <a href="http://links.epanorama.net/links/automation.html#home">Home Automation</a>,<a href="http://links.epanorama.net/links/standards.html">Standards</a> and <a href="http://links.epanorama.net/links/lights.html">Lighting Control</a>.
Theres also an index of <a href="http://www.hometoys.com/standards.htm">prexisting standards</a> on <a href="http://www.hometoys.com/resources.htm">Home Toys</a>.</p>
