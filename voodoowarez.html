<h2>allegory of the code : chains of the application</h2>
<h3>a non adaption of another certain Cave allegory</h3>

<p>Behold! Human beings living in an underground den, which has a mouth open<br>
towards the light and reaching all along the den; here they have been from their<br>
childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move,<br> 
and can only see before them, being prevented by the chains from turning<br> 
round their heads. Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance, built<br> 
along the way, like the screen which marionette players have in front of them,<br>
over which they show the puppets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>I see.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels,<br>
and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone and various<br> 
materials, which appear over the wall? Some of them are talking, others silent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>You have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or the shadows<br>
of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>True, he said; how could they see anything but the shadows if they were<br> 
never allowed to move their heads?</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>we've had personal computers for three decades now.<br>
now begins the aeon of personal computation.</p>

<h2>all is one</h2>
<h3>the Voodoo Warez philosophy</h3>

<p>all living systems exist as ecologies, as dynanic and changing webs of interconnectivity. everything is interrelated.<br> 
by respecting the user as an agent of the system, VoodooWarez will create a information ecosystem where users can flourish.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>we've let the application grow to far out of control, define too much.<br>
applications are the greatest monoculture ever built.<br>
like shadows on the wall, interface is but a machination,<br>
little more than idolatry to hide our true systems from us.<br>
there is no true path down this road, only more focus groups.<br>
we need to set data free, set our systems free, and set the users free.<br>
ecology will take care of the rest.</p>

<p><i>Voodoo Warez Productions is a rag tag programmer<br>
with a simple philosophy;<br>
<b>all is one</b>.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did you never observe the narrow intelligence flashing from the keen<br>
eye of a clever rogue, how eager he is, how clearly his paltry soul<br>
sees the way to his end; he is the reverse of blind, but his keen<br>
eye-sight is forced into the service of evil, and he is mischievous<br>
in proportion to his cleverness?</p>
